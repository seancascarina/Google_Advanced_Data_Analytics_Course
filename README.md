# Google's Advanced Data Analytics Course
This repository contains completed exercises (Jupyter notebooks) from Google's Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. The course was broken into 6 sections, followed by a Capstone project (see [EmployeeChurn_PredictionModels](https://github.com/seancascarina/EmployeeChurn_PredictionModels) repository). Sections 2-6 of the course each had multiple Jupyter notebooks that I completed as part of the course, which I have organized into subdirectories in this repository.
